# Jeopardy Clone

This is not a commercial application and was made solely for at home preparation for my girlfriend's mom's jeopardy appearance.

Currently you can edit the questions by changing some variables in the root `page.tsx`

There are also some extra components and stuff that are not being used cause I was messing around with some other libraries and then last minute converted this into a jeopardy clone.

It also is storing question visbility in session storage so you'll need to close your tab and reopen the application to display all questions again.
